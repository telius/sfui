## Overview

Sfui aims to provide a modular, lightweight, and "set-and-forget" interface that handles everything you used to need multiple addons or WeakAuras for. It focuses on clarity, automation, and providing the right information at the right time.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Buffs & Reminders
Intelligent tracking of raid buffs, personal consumables, and class mechanics. The system automatically filters for relevant buffs based on your class and group composition.
