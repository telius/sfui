### Castbars
Enhanced cast visualization for both player and target.
- **Player Castbar**: Clean, high-fidelity bar with integrated **Instant Cast Tracking** (shows a quick highlight when instant spells are used). Supports Empowered (Evoker) spell stages with dynamic color shifting.

    - **Sequential Rotation**: Each click or keybind press repairs the next item in the list (Priority: Weapons/Shields -> Plate Armor).
    - **Spam Proof**: Advances the target immediately on click, allowing you to spam all repairs in a single GCD window without double-casting.
